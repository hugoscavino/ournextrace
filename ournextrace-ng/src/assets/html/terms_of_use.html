                pages and profiles on such channels and platforms, together with the Site and Apps, are our “Channels”. 
            </li>
            <li>Our Channels provide information about sporting endurance events taking place all over the world
                (“Events”). All Events we provide information about and which are promoted on our Channels are organised by third parties. We do not run
                Events ourselves. If you organise Events and want to promote them via our Channels please contact events@OurNextRace.com

                Members agree that we may send them information about Events which we think may be of interest to them
                basedon the criteria they have selected. We may also provide Members with other facilities, such as
                maintaining a record of their performances and achievements.
